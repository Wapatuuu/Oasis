                    <h2>Who Are Oasis?</h2>
                    <p class="left-align">Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as the Rain, the group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) later joined as a fifth member, finalising the group's core lineup.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe(1994). As of 2009, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide. They are among the most successful acts on the UK Singles Chart and Albums Chart, with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums.</p>

                    <p class="left-align">Definitely Maybe is the debut studio album by English rock band Oasis, released by Creation Records on 29 August 1994.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">Oasis booked Monnow Valley Studio near Rockfield in late 1993 to record the album and worked with producer Dave Batchelor, whom band member Noel Gallagher knew from his days working as a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets, though sessions were unsatisfactory and Batchelor was subsequently fired.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">It is the only studio album to feature all five original members, as founding member drummer Tony McCarroll was sacked from the band in 1995. Definitely Maybe was an immediate commercial and critical success in the United Kingdom, having followed on the heels of the singles "Supersonic", "Shakermaker", and the UK top-ten hit "Live Forever", which was also a success on US Rock Airplay.</p>

                    <p class="right-align">(What's the Story) Morning Glory? is the second studio album by English rock band Oasis. Released on 2 October 1995 by Creation Records, it was produced by Owen Morris and the group's guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous album Definitely Maybe (1994).</p>
                    <p class="right-align"> Gallagher's compositions were more focused in balladry and placed more emphasis on "huge" choruses, with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. Morning Glory was the group's first album with drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll (though McCarroll still appeared on the album, drumming on the track "Some Might Say")."</p>

                    <p class="left-align">Be Here Now is the third studio album by English rock band Oasis, released on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. The album was recorded at multiple recording studios in London, including Abbey Road Studios, as well as Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">Although most tracks retain the anthemic quality of previous releases, the songs on Be Here Now are longer and contain many guitar overdubs. Noel Gallagher said this was done to make the album sound as "colossal" as possible.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">The album cover features a shot of the band members at Stocks House in Hertfordshire. It is the last Oasis studio album to feature founding members guitarist Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and bassist Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan as the two left in 1999.</p>

                    <p class="right-align">Standing on the Shoulder of Giants is the fourth studio album by English rock band Oasis, released on 28 February 2000. It was the band's first album under their new record label Big Brother Recordings.</p>
                    <p class="righ-align">In the year preceding the album's release, Alan McGee closed Creation Records, and Oasis had lost two founding members (Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan) and hired new producer Mark "Spike" Stent to replace Owen Morris.</p>
                    <p class="right-align">The album marked a significant change from the Britpop scene to a modern psychedelic record complete with drum loops, samples, electric sitar, mellotron, synthesizers and backward guitars, resulting in an album more experimental with electronica and heavy psychedelic rock influences. Songs such as "Go Let It Out", the Indian-influenced "Who Feels Love?", and the progressive "Gas Panic!" departed from the band's earlier style. This album also marked the first time that lead singer Liam Gallagher contributed on songwriting ("Little James"), and this tradition was continued for their subsequent albums, instead of primarily Noel Gallagher's songwriting in the first three albums.</p>

                    <p class="left-align">Familiar to Millions is a live album by English rock band Oasis. It was released on 13 November 2000 by Big Brother Recordings. The album was recorded at Wembley Stadium on 22 July 2000.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">It debuted at No. 5 in the UK charts with 57,000 copies sold in the first week. To date Familiar to Millions has sold around 310,000 copies in Britain alone (Platinum), about 70,000 copies in the United States and an estimated 1 million copies worldwide.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">The album was initially released simultaneously on six formats: DVD, VHS, double CD, double cassette, triple vinyl, and double MiniDisc..</p>

                    <p class="right-align">It is the first Oasis album recorded with guitarist Gem Archer and bassist Andy Bell, who both joined the band after work on previous album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants had been completed.</p>
                    <p class="right-align">It is the last album to feature longtime drummer, Alan White, who left in early 2004, with Noel Gallagher claiming White's commitment to the band was not adequate.</p>

                    <p class="left-align">Don't Believe the Truth is the sixth studio album by English rock band Oasis. It was released on 30 May 2005 by Big Brother Recordings. It reached number one in the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of 237,865, and is the 32nd fastest selling album ever in the UK.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006 (900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies.</p>
                    <p class="left-align">As with the previous album, Don't Believe The Truth had significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter Noel Gallagher, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs.</p>

                    <p class="right-align">Dig Out Your Soul is the seventh and final studio album by English rock band Oasis. It was released on 6 October 2008 by Big Brother Recordings. The album was recorded between August and December 2007 at Abbey Road Studios in London, and mixed in January and March 2008 at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. Production was handled by Dave Sardy who had previously produced much of the group's sixth studio album, Don't Believe the Truth (2005). Lead guitarist Noel Gallagher wrote a majority of the songs, while three were written by Liam as well as one contribution each from Gem Archer and Andy Bell.</p>
                    <p class="right-align">The album was supported by three singles. The first single, "The Shock of the Lightning", was released shortly before the release of the album, on 29 September 2008. In addition to the standard release, there was also a limited edition boxset containing the album on CD, a bonus disc containing extra material and remixes, a DVD with a documentary of the making of the album, four 12" vinyl discs that contained all the music from the CDs cut in high-quality 45rpm and a hardback book of album artwork.</p>
